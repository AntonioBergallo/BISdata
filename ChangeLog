        * R/functions.R: export functions 'datasets'
        and 'fetch_dataset'; remove "csv" from names as
        apparently not all full datasets are in CSV
        format
        (process_dataset): add support for transforming
        datasets into 'zoo' series
        (datasets): return "filename", "description"
        and date of last "update"

        * README.org: add README
